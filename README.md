## log
	- tictactoe
	
		- when I tried to fetch the blocks of the gameboard using childNodes property, additional #text node also appeared
		
 		  --> The main difference between children and childNodes property is that children work upon elements and childNodes on nodes including non-element nodes
 		   like text and comment nodes.
 		
 		- completed till point 4
 		- does not display It's a draw..
